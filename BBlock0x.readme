Kurz:         Bootblock (auch) f√ºr Beta-Kickstarts

The BBlock0x.bb is a generic OFS bootblock that loads DOS with any
tested Amiga Kickstart (included in Amiga Forever 9 Plus Edition).

While testing a custom bootblock I stumbled over an issue with the
Kickstart Beta 0.7 (the I/O request in A1 has to be preserved, and
any call to exec.library/OpenLibrary will lock/freeze the system).

For the sake of completeness, the bootblocks for later versions of
the DOS filesystem are also included (well, OS has to support it).
